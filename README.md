# MP3-Stripper-Front-End
A front end for the notorious "youtube-dl" which enables the user to download the audio of youtube videos without having to open up a browser.
It has a queueing function, and a search function but that's about it. Acts as an overlay to Youtube-dl. Requires Youtube-dl to be downloaded.
